            <p>Me and my family have taken four trips to Yelapa, Mexico.<br>
            It is a very small town in a cove on the edge of mountains and the ocean, so there are no roads that can access Yelapa, you can only get there by boat.<br>
         There is no police in Yelapa, all the shops and restaurants are ran and owned by locals, because there is a law that only allows you to own land in Yelapa if you're a mexican citizen who has lived in Yelapa ?+ amount of years.<br>
      Everything is really cheap, really good and a little run down.</p>
