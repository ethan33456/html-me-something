            <h1>Arriving in Yelapa</h1>
            <p>Me and my family have taken four trips to Yelapa, Mexico.<br>
            It is a very small town in a cove on the edge of mountains and the ocean, so there are no roads that can access Yelapa, you can only get there by boat.<br>
         There is no police in Yelapa, all the shops and restaurants are ran and owned by locals, because there is a law that only allows you to own land in Yelapa if you're a mexican citizen who has lived in Yelapa ?+ amount of years.<br>
      Everything is really cheap, really good and a little run down.</p>

            <h1>Cheap Food</h1>
            <p>This is a bill from our favorite restaurant in Yelapa Cafe Bahia.<br>
            The bill was $60 for 6 people where we all gut full meals and a drink or smoothie.</p>

            <p>
               This is the morning view from the "condo" we stayed in on our last visit.
               That condo wasn't too bad except that it was in the main part of the village, so we were woken up early every morning by roosters and mules hooves on pavement.
               And when we first arrived there the couch inside was infested with ants but they took care of that for us.
               This place had a wall on 3 sides but was completely open to the outside like every other place we stayed.
