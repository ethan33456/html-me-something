            <h1>Arriving in Yelapa</h1>
            <p>Me and my family have taken four trips to Yelapa, Mexico.<br>
            It is a very small town in a cove on the edge of mountains and the ocean, so there are no roads that can access Yelapa, you can only get there by boat.<br>
         There is no police in Yelapa, all the shops and restaurants are ran and owned by locals, because there is a law that only allows you to own land in Yelapa if you're a mexican citizen who has lived in Yelapa ?+ amount of years.<br>
      Everything is really cheap, really good and a little run down.</p>

            <h1>Cheap Food</h1>
            <p>This is a bill from our favorite restaurant in Yelapa Cafe Bahia.<br>
            The bill was $60 for 6 people where we all gut full meals and a drink or smoothie.</p>

            <h1>Where we stayed</h1>
            <p>
               This is the morning view from the "condo" we stayed in on our last visit.<br>
               That condo wasn't too bad except that it was in the main part of the village, so we were woken up early every morning by roosters and mules hooves on pavement.<br>
               And when we first arrived there the couch inside was infested with ants but they took care of that for us.<br>
               This place had a wall on 3 sides but was completely open to the outside like every other place we stayed.

            <h1>Critters Everywhere</h1>
            <p>
               This is one of the huge spiders that infested the tall trees overhead.<br>
               One trip me and my brother were staying in a hut seperate from my parents and sister, and there was a spider on the outside of our (one) wall bigger than my hand. (I was too scared to put my hand next to it to take a picture)<br>
               In the slightly bigger hut my parents and sister were staying in nearby, my sister picked up a couch cushion and there was a scorpion, they trapped it with a jar.<br>
               There was also an army of literally thousands of ants that would use the support beam going across the rough as a shortcut during there path through the jungle, there was a solid line of ants 24/7.<br>
               In addition to insects stray dogs and chickens roamed everywhere (now that I think about it im surprised the hungry dogs didn't eat the chickens).

            <h1>Puerto Vallarta</h1>
            <p>
               On our latest trip my grandparents wanted to come to mexico with us, but they are to old to be jumping in and out of boats and walking everywhere up hills, so they met us in Puerto Vallarta and we stayed there for 5 days.<br>
               While in Puerto Vallarta we stayed in a house on the side of mountains overlooking the ocean and we were back in a place with the normal luxuries we take for granted.<br>
               I like Yelapa much better.<br>
               One day we went to the beach near our house and got food from an iffy restaurant on the day before our last.<br>
               Long story short me and my mom got montezumas revenge and it didnt hit us till we were on our plain ride home.<br>
               Our plane landed in dallas instead of austin because of bad weather. The AA flight attendants ridiculously claimed we couldnt get off in dallas because it "wasnt an international airport"<br>
               So we had to say it was a medical emergency so eventually they let us off to be picked up by ambulance people not in an ambulance saying they "have to" take us to the hospital.<br>
               My mom a former nurse refused saying she knows we dont have to go. The airlines people wouldnt let my girlfriend or siblings off the plaine with us. only my dad got to come. They eventually ended up in austin and we rented a car, drove home and picked them up on the way.<br>
